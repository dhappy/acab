# ACAB

ACAB is, at it's heart a roving car. It always carries at least two people. There are three different roles the two people can perform:

* As the Driver and a Clerk who provides access to an in-car inventory.
* As part of response team to a call for assistance. There are five roles in the response team:
  * The Driver responsible for the vehicle.
  * The Cameraperson responsible for livestreaming everything to the cloud.
  * The Muscle responsible for any physical tasks.
  * The Mediator responsible for interfacing with anyone external to the team.
  * Comms responsible for tools and interfacing with the organization at large.
* As Driver and Courier for delivering parcels.
