      <p><acronym title='All Cops Are Bastards'>ACAB</acronym> wants to out-police the police.</p>

      <p>Ideally, a car carries a team of five people:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The Driver responsible for the vehicle.</li>
        <li>The Cameraperson responsible for livestreaming everything to the cloud.</li>
        <li>The Muscle responsible for any physical tasks.</li>
        <li>The Mouth responsible for interfacing with anyone external to the team.</li>
        <li>Comms responsible for tools and interfacing with the organization at large.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Because of the pandemic, these five roles can be filled by two people. At the least, the Mouth and the Cameraperson need to be separate people. The Cameraperson should be solely concerned with getting a recording of the events uploaded to the cloud.</p>

      <p>Like with 911, your first contact is with a dispatcher. They handle finding a team to respond.</p>

      <p>Patrols report their position to dispatch. Police are paid a fixed wage for time on patrol or training.</p>

      <p>I would like all police activities to be saved in the cloud and have some system of governance for its publicity.</p>

      <p>The Muscle doesn't carry a gun. Any of the others can within legal limits.</p>

      <p>I would like to see the widespread use of non-lethal rounds. I would like a general rule that firearms will never be brandished first be the agents.</p>

      <p>One initial focus is traffic stops. As someone is getting stopped, they tell their smart phone and active patrols are notified.</p>

      <p>The vehicle pulls in front of the stop and the Mouth followed by the Cameraperson approach the scene.</p>

      <p>One common police tactic is swarming and overpowering any opposition through sheer numbers. I want the team to be able to respond by calling in more teams.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><button>Patrols In Your Area</button></li>
      </ul>

      <p>When the pair is in the car without a call they operate as couriers for both ridesharers and goods.</p>

      <p>If a ride is interrupted by a call, the dispatcher handles rerouting anything in the car.</p>
